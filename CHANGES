CHANGES
=======

* Mutil 1.76.1 (10/27/10)
    - First public release

* Mutil 1.76.2 (01/04/11)
    - Removed Makefile that was used to create distribution
    - Added patch to upgrade from previous version
    - Added deallocation code for semaphores and queues
    - Fixed high memory utilization when using hash trees
    - Removed MPI thread limitation that prevented memory overruns
      since problem was caused by old hash tree code

* Mutil 1.76.3 (08/25/11)
    - Added note about need for static version of libgpg-error
    - Hash of stdin (i.e. piped input and file name "-") now works in msum
    - Hash output format of mcp now exactly matches msum
    - Added --check-tree option to isolate corruption
    - Added --offset and --length options to copy/sum a specific file subset
    - Added file restriping to mcp based on file size for Lustre targets
    - Added --print-stripe to mcp to print striping changes to stderr
    - Fixed divide by 0 when hash leaf size is 0 due to default split size
    - Changed hash output so non-standard output is reported in comments
    - Now adjust split size to buffer size when 0 < split size < buffer size
    - Fixed making of holes in mcp in double buffer case
    - Split --fadvise into --fadvise-read and --fadvise-write
    - Added --skip-chmod to mcp to retain temporary permissions used during copy
    - Fixed --direct-read errors on some file systems due to last unaligned read

* Mutil 1.76.4 (09/01/11)
    - Fixed race condition between last unaligned read and disabling direct I/O
      when --direct-read and --double-buffer enabled

* Mutil 1.76.5 (09/12/11)
    - Fixed references to fadvise/--fadvise instead of
      fadvise_read/--fadvise-read (bug report by W. Kettler)
    - Fixed error messages referencing --read_stdin instead of --read-stdin

* Mutil 1.76.6 (10/15/12)
    - Fixed various compiler warnings
    - Fixed last zero-length read when --double-buffer enabled
    - Fixed improper off_t parsing of various options
    - Fixed offset of last posix_fadvise on write buffer
    - Fixed unaligned file offsets during --direct-read
    - Fixed alignment multiple, which must be higher than open man page states
    - Added ability to set posix_fadvise as default in reads and/or writes

* Mutil 1.76.7 (01/24/14)
    - Fixed segfault when hashing multiple portions of the same file
      that are larger than the split size during --read-stdin
    - Fixed segfault when hashing unreadable file
    - Added --dst-offset option to copy to specific position in target
    - Added --stripe-count option to set absolute/size-relative striping
    - Added --print-src option to show src file instead of dst during
      --print-stats and --print-hash
    - Added ability to copy/hash zero length subsets of files
    - Removed --store-hash option since not viable given xattr performance
    - Added some notes about CentOS/RHEL in INSTALL

* Mutil 1.76.8 (05/19/14)
    - Fixed intermittent deadlock due to misbehaving OpenMP locks
      (bug report and debugging support by G. Butler)

* Mutil 1.822.1 (01/08/15)
    - Updated to 8.x coreutils with improved sparse file handling/performance
    - Added ability to enable/disable static linking of gcrypt/gnutls
    - Added --preallocate option to minimize extents of non-sparse files
    - Fixed gnutls tests to check for srp functions missing on centos/rhel
    - Fixed missing ENONMEM during gcrypt thread enable on centos/rhel
    - Fixed no longer used parameters to hash functions
    - Fixed final file size during partial copy with hole at end

* Mutil 1.822.2 (01/14/15)
    - Fixed ignored #mutil# prefix in msum during -c
    - Fixed compiler warnings for gnutls_transport_set_ptr/LOV_MAX_STRIPE_COUNT
    - Removed references to gnutls-extra since no longer exists in recent gnutls
    - Removed note about hash leaf size adjustment during some cases
    - Removed --as-needed from ld args since not always supported (e.g. OSX)
    - Added workarounds when clock_gettime does not exist (e.g. OSX)
    - Changed to System V semaphores since POSIX semaphores broken on OSX
    - Now supports OSX (note that default gcc 4.2.1 does not support OpenMP)

* Mutil 1.822.3 (03/03/15)
    - Fixed write error handling when double buffering enabled
    - Added additional asynchronous i/o error handling

* Mutil 1.822.4 (04/14/16)
    - Fixed final file size in some cases when src ends with hole
    - Fixed --sparse=never corruption in some cases when --double-buffer enabled

* Mutil 1.822.5 (01/18/18)
    - Fixed preservation of execute permission on recent lustre versions
    - Fixed compiler warnings for direct include of liblustreapi.h
    - Fixed handling of long input lines when using --read-stdin
